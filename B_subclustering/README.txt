# B subclustering and T-B correlation

The B cell UMAP and subsequent analysis (e.g.assessing gene expression or BCR analysis with annotated clusters) can be done once the subclustering Seurat object is made. 

pbmc_cluster_annotation.csv provides the cluster number and annotation of each of our clusters in the PBMC seurat object. 

The T-B correlation script quantifies the Ki67+ T and Ki67+ B cell relationship in Figure 5g, for both scRNA-seq and flow cytometry data. The data inputs for each are also included.
