#PBMC_umap

To generate PBMC UMAP, use filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz files for each sample (found in the GSE accession number associated with Ramaswamy et al. 2021), as well as hashing files (relevant for COVID-19 and Adult healthy donor samples).

Other scripts may be run following the generation of the fully integrated Seurat object
